This program takes a string and pads it with a certain amount of placeholders. If the string is longer than the padding specified, then it will leave the string as is.

## What I've learned
* I can write a for loop that executes in some situations and doesnt for others depending on if the condition statement in the for loop is already returning false
* learned about .length() method
* Practicing what I know
* Slowly building better problem solving skills
